    <p>At DanStudioWeb, we make websites that are built with precision and creativity. I'm Daniel, a passionate web dev who believes that websites should be more than a collection of pages-it should be an experience(like this website!). Unlike cookie-cutter templates or drag and drop web builders, I hand code every project to ensure speed, funtionaltiy, and a unique design that fits your brand or cause perfectly. Whether you need a sleek portfolio, an innovative business site, or an interactive web app, I bring your ideas to life with clean, optimized and resposnive design.<br><br>I'm the only one doing this. I handle every think through orders, maintenence, and even the making of this site. Since I have no employees(yet...), it would be nice if you would donate to support me! <br><strong>Cashapp</strong> - $DanWebStudio<br><strong>BuyMeACoffee</strong> - <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dangy">buymeacoffee.com/dangy</a> </p> <p style="color: red;"><strong>DISCLAIMER!!</strong></p><p> We don't host your site we give you all the files and you host the site yourself <strong> BUT </strong> we can help you do it! but we will have to talk about extra cost and stuff out off <br><br> Also you can only pay me thru cashapp or donations</p>
